# Python Tkinter Application Manager

## What this does

The purpose of this application is to create an
easy-to-use application manager for Tkinter. I plan to
use this to create some pre-built utilities for doing
calculations and creates graphs etc, but can also be
used to do other things that users can create (with
upcoming documentation on how to use this to it it's
full extent).

## Installation info

Recommended version: Python 3.8.2

However, most/all versions above Python 3.0 should work.
